1. HashMap : 
   Allows duplicates (overrides)
   Using Iterator, For Each,
   Map.Entry<String, String> m = map.entrySet();
   Iterator <Map.Entry<String, String>> k = map.keySet().iterator;
   
 Understanding how HashMap works 
 
 	Use a technique called Hashing.
 	Hashing Helps in faster indexing and lookups.
 	In Java each and every class has hashCode() as all class inherits (Object class).
 	You need to have robust hashcode and equals methods. Since they work hand to hand.
 	HashMap<K,V> extends AbstractMap implements Clonable, Serializable.
 	HashMap has array Node<K,V>[] table;
 	Node<K,V> int hash, K key, V value, Node <K,V> next;
 	Each Node (Bucket) is an array of Linked List
 	HashMap comes by a table of 16
 	While put in hashmpa first we compute the hashcode and then module for the index
 	While get in hashmap first we call again hashcode and then module for the index
 	  Then we go to the index then we compare hashcode and then for the comparing the key we use equals() method
 	If the linked list size become 8 then it takes balance tree in Java 8
