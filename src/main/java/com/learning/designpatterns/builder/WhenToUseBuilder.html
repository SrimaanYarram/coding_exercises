<u><b>When to use Builder Design pattern in Java</b></u>

<br></br>

Builder Design pattern is a object creational pattern and should be used when number of parameter required in constructor is more than manageable usually 4 or at most 5. 
Don't confuse with Builder and Factory pattern there is an obvious difference between Builder and Factory pattern, as Factory can be used to create different implementation of same interface but Builder is tied up with its Container class and only returns object of Outer class.

<p>
That's all on Builder design pattern in Java. we have seen why we need Builder pattern, what problem it solves, Example of builder design pattern in Java and finally when to use Builder patter with pros and cons.
So if you are not using telescoping constructor pattern or have a choice not to use it than Builder pattern is way to go.
