/**
 * Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
 * For example,
 * Given input array nums = [1,1,2],
 * Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

/**
 * Approach #1 (Two Pointers) [Accepted]
 * Algorithm
 * Since the array is already sorted, we can keep two pointers ii and jj, where ii is the slow-runner while jj is the fast-runner. As long as nums[i] = nums[j]nums[i]=nums[j], we increment jj to skip the duplicate.
 * When we encounter nums[j] \neq nums[i]nums[j]≠nums[i], the duplicate run has ended so we must copy its value to nums[i + 1]nums[i+1]. ii is then incremented and we repeat the same process again until jj reaches the end of array.
